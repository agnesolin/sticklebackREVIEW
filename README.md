# sticklebackREVIEW
Code and data to reproduce plots in review article of Baltic Sea sticklebacks.

Data for Fig 1 and Fig 2a-c come from the ICES Baltic International Acoustic Survey (see Olsson et al. 2019 for details). 

Data for Fig 2d-f come from juveniles surveys during the spawning season using underwater detonations (see Eklöf et al. 2020 for details).

Data for Fig 2g-h come from sticklebacks caught in the cooling water intake of the Forsmark nuclear power plant on the Swedish coast (see Adill et al. 2018 for details).

Data for Fig 2i come from traps set out during the spawning season along the Finnish coast, and were extracted from Candolin and Voigt (2020) using https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/.

Data for Fig 2j-k come from beach seines during the spawning season along the Latvian coast (see Olsson et al. 2015 for details).

Data for Fig 4a were extracted from Olsson (2019). Data for Fig 4b-f were obtained from https://standardgraphs.ices.dk. Data for Fig 4g were obtained from https://metadata.helcom.fi/geonetwork/srv/eng/catalog.search#/metadata/a30a77d1-12b6-47b4-a520-a54331bdbf41. Data for Fig 4h were extracted from Andersen et al. (2017) using https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/. Data for Fig 4i were obtained from doi.org/10.48670/moi-00206. None of these datsets are provided here but would have to be recreated from sources.  

Data for Fig 5 come from juveniles surveys during the spawning season using underwater detonations (see Eklöf et al. 2020 for details).
